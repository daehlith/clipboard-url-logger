# clipboard-url-logger
> A desktop program that monitors the clipboard for URLs and logs them automatically.

This started as a small experiment inspired by [this blog post](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/thisprojectwillonlytake.html) and the ensuing [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29161194).
I am very much in agreement with the author's point of view. Sure, it took me only about an hour to get to this stage. But _this_ stage is nothing more than a proof-of-concept, and far away from a usable product. It takes a lot more than a few hours to create an actual product.

However, now it's my playground for cross-platform desktop application development using Qt 6.

### Time spent

- boilerplate (e.g. installing tools, compilers, IDE, etc.): 1 hour (sans download speed)
- MVP clipboard monitoring for URLs and rudimentary play/pause support: 2 hours
- learning about application icons on macOS and Windows: 1 hour
- macOS application icon: 1 hour
- Windows application icon: 1 hour
- learning how to create installers with CPack: 1 hour
- macOS installer: 1 hour
- Windows installer: 1 hour
